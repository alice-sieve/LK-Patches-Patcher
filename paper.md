# Summary

We are publishing a tool given a patch publishing in any mailing list, it will track
the behavior or maintainers and implementation from Linux Kernel Contributors. Till
now there has been no study on the patches published on Linux Kernel trees. We propose
an implementation given any patch published on any tree present in mainline Linux
Kernel, the patches are made available and static C analyzer are implemented. Given
the mailing list integration this would greatly reduce the effort of patches
submmited in Linux Kernel and creating a base for the patches submitted. Linux Kernel
is huge and important and present everywhere. We also publish the evolution of the
linux kernel and a poll with the maintainers where they suggest the patches they recieve.
